I apologise for ignoring all of you that have enjoyed my posts so far! I have been quiet and neglecting my blog for the last year. During that time life had decided to throw me a few hard challenges I needed to work through. Some positive and some negative, Covid being a main one. It was a hard journey with a lot of growth in my both personally and professionally. 

I look forward to kick off this blog again! Until next time ðŸ˜‰
