In amongst all the web development projects and apps while trying to still look awake at work. I have managed to find some valuable time to build myself a new and improved site where I can connect to you!

Thats right this blog will contain helpful hints on web development and some quick and easy code snippets or plugins to help you in your web development careers!

I hope you will enjoy this as much as I am. Look forward to seeing you soon!
