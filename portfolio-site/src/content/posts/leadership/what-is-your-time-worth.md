I have built a lot of things for fun in my free time. Random ideas become small prototypes and some of those I have followed through to be full releases. It is easy to think of these things as just personal work because there is no outside force besides yourself.

But in reality, every hour you spend is still costing something, even when no money changes hands, your time is still being used. What is your time worth?

## The Myth of Free Time

When you are working on your own project it is easy to loose track of time. You convince yourself you are learning or experimenting, which is true, but it can also distract you from what that time is worth.

A Saturday spent writing code for your dream idea might not feel like work, but that is still time you could have used for something else, like that hike your friends invited you on. There is nothing wrong with putting time into your project but it is worth asking what that time is costing you.

## Time Has Value, Even When You Don't Charge

If you pay someone else to do the a task, you have decided what your own time is worth. You have traded money for free time, and that exchange says a lot about the value you place on it.

It is easy to forget when there is no money swapping hands. Without physically having to pay it is harder to measure cost but your time still has a value. 

The trick is to make sure you spend it with intention, not by habit.

## How to Value Your Time

Knowing your time has value is one thing, but actually putting a number to it helps you make clearer decisions.

Start simple. Think about what your time is worth to you in three ways:

- Financial Value – What would someone pay for your skills, or what would you pay someone else to free up that same time?
- Energy Value – How much effort or focus does it take? An hour of deep creative work is not equal to an hour scrolling or cleaning up tasks.
- Fulfilment Value – Does it make you feel proud, curious, or satisfied? Sometimes emotional value outweighs money.

When you look at your projects through that perscpective, it is easier to see what is actually giving you a good return and what is just filling time.

The goal is not to put a price on everything you do. It is to stay conscious of where you are spending your time and what you are really getting in exchange.

## Why We Undervalue Ourselves

I have noticed a lot of people downplay personal projects because they feel smaller or less serious. It is easy to convince yourself that it is just something you are building on the side.

That way of thinking that quietly build a mindset to undervalues your work. You might even stop recognising that the same energy and skillset you would bring to a paid role is the same energy you are spending on your own project.

Passion is important, but so is perspective.

## Looking at Return on Time, Not Just Return on Investment

When you start thinking of your time as your main budget, it becomes easier to prioritise what will actually bring you value and to see the real return. Every project you invest your time in will give something back, just not always the same way.

Some of those returns might be:
- Learning Value – Did you improve your skills?
- Creative Value – Did it recharge your curiosity or burn you out?
- Portfolio Value – Does it show what you can do?
- Financial Value – Can it lead to opportunities later?

You might not need any of those to feel a return, but you should feel like you are getting something back for the time that you put in.

## Knowing When to Stop or Pivot

Sometimes a project teaches you what it needs to, and that is enough. Other times it grows into something bigger.

If a prototype keeps pulling your attention, maybe it is ready to be shared or built into a product. If it is draining your energy, it might be time to move on.

Many of my projects at FoVR Interactive started as small experiments. The ones that I enjoyed the most grew into full experiences like Forge Of Elements, while others stayed as learning pieces like my Rubik's cube solver. Either way, the time I spent was valuable because it gave me new learnings and stronger portfolio pieces.

## Final Thoughts

Every hour you spend is an investment into your future self. Even when no one is watching you, you are still spending something that matters.

Your time is limited, and once it is spent, you can't get it back. Spend it on things that will build you up, and be mindful when something is only keeping you busy.

Next time you sit down to work on a project, ask yourself one simple question: What is this time worth?
