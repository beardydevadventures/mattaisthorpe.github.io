I’ve recently started exploring VR and have been enjoying my time with the Meta Quest (previously known as the Oculus Quest). One of its handy features is the ability to cast what you see in the headset to other devices on the same Wi-Fi network, including a computer, phone, or smart TV.

Using Meta Quest Link, you can also play VR games on your PC. The other night, I wanted to share my gameplay with friends on Discord, but I ran into an issue: when trying to stream SteamVR on Discord, only the SteamVR status window was visible to my viewers. It took me an amount of time to figure out a fix, but once I did, streaming worked perfectly.

## How to Stream Meta Quest to Discord

Follow these steps to share your Quest gameplay on Discord:

1. First, on your computer, open your preferred browser and go to [oculus.com/casting](https://oculus.com/casting) then log in to your Meta Quest account.
2. Put on your headset and press the Meta button on your controller to open the universal menu.
3. Select **Sharing** then choose **Cast**.
4. Select **Computer** then click **Next**.
5. Select **Done**. The view of your headset should now be showing in the browser.
6. Back on your computer open **Discord**.
7. Select one of your **servers** you have permission to cast to.
8. Select a channel to stream to.
9. Click Share Screen (found at the bottom of the Discord interface).
10. Choose the browser window displaying your Meta Quest cast feed.

That’s it! You are now successfully streaming your VR gameplay to Discord. I hope this guide helps you set up your stream quickly and easily. Happy gaming!
