I build many projects testing our new ideas from *ResumeAIWriter* to *Forge of Elements* that have been built outside of my 9-5 job.

I have learned during this process that you need to make time to work on your passions and small, consistent steps are what really move things forward.

This post is about how I balance full-time work with side projects, and why **consistency builds progress**.

### Why Side Projects Matter

I use my side projects as a way to test new ideas, experiment with emerging tech and keep in touch with my creative side. Having the freedom to create was one of my biggest drives to get into the digital space.

Working on side projects has opened many doors. Opportunites like the Meta Quest Start Program and connecting with leading influencers in the VR space have been made possible through my projects I tinkered on after hours. None of this would have happened if I waited for the perfect time to start.

### Finding the Time

I rarely get whole weekends free to just sit and build. What I try to do instead is carve out smaller blocks of focus:
- An hour or two at night  
- A planned slot during the week
- A short burst on the weekend when energy allows

It adds up. You don't need to ship a full project in a weekend. You just need to chip away at it, one piece at a time.

### The Challenges Along the Way

Balancing side projects with full-time work isn’t always smooth sailing. There are weeks where motivation drops, work deadlines spill over, or projects sit untouched longer than I would like.  

The big trick isn't to avoid these moments or feel defeated. We are only human. What matters is learning how to reset and pick things back up. Progress comes from persistence, not perfection.

### Avoiding Burnout

The hardest part is not trying to do everything at once. I've got notebooks and sheets full of ideas, but I know I can't chase them all.  

What helps:
- Picking one project to move forward
- Parking the rest for later
- Accepting that some ideas will stay as sketches, and that is fine

And sometimes, the best move is to close the computer and take a walk. Rest is part of the process.

### Making Progress Visible

Sharing progess can be highly motivating. Share your current progress in a LinkedIn update or on my Beardy Dev adventure socials has helped me make the work feel more real. Even sending a screenshot to a friend can give you some pride in your project.

Posting updates not only helps keep the momentum going it shows the progress you have been making but keeps it visible and real. This momentum is hard to stop once it is going and makes it easier to keep finding time to make progress.

### What I've Learned

- You don't need a perfect build to release.  
- Small updates are better than no updates.  
- Most importantly: **consistency builds progress.**

You don't need massive bursts of productivity. You just need to keep showing up, even in small steps. Over time, you'll look back and realise you've actually built something and the journey you took to get where you are.

### Key Takeaways

- *Don't wait for the perfect conditions:* Start small, make it real.  
- *Protect your energy:* Focus on one project at a time.  
- *Share progress early:* to stay motivated.  
- **Consistency builds progress.**

### Final Thoughts

Building on the side while working full-time isn't about sacrifice or waiting for the right conditions. It's about making the most of the time you have, staying realistic, and enjoying the process.
