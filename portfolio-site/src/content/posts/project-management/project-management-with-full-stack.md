Transitioning from full-stack development to project management might seem like a shift away from hands-on coding, but in reality, it provides an invaluable foundation for leading technical projects effectively. Having walked the path of both development and management, I’ve found that my background as a full-stack developer has significantly enhanced my ability to manage teams, make informed decisions, and ensure project success.

## Bridging the Gap Between Teams

One of the biggest advantages of being a project manager with full-stack development experience is the ability to communicate fluently with both front-end and back-end developers. This technical knowledge fosters better collaboration, as I can understand and address challenges from both perspectives. Rather than acting as a middleman relaying information, I can engage in meaningful conversations with the team, ensuring that roadblocks are identified early and solutions are practical.

> For instance, at CQUniversity, I supported developers by asking the right questions and gathering key details for a project requiring API calls. By addressing these questions early, I helped developers set up their work efficiently and reduced back-and-forth communication.
## More Effective Decision-Making

Technical projects often require making critical decisions under tight constraints. A project manager with full-stack experience can evaluate trade-offs more effectively, ensuring that the chosen solutions align with both business goals and technical feasibility. Whether it’s choosing the right tech stack, estimating development timelines, or assessing potential risks, a hands-on background allows for more strategic planning.

> When I led the project at CQUniversity that involved migrating Sharepoint 2013 to Sharepoint Online, my understanding of both the old and new architectures helped me guide the team through a phased approach, reducing downtime and ensuring a smooth transition.

## Greater Empathy for Developers

Having experienced firsthand the challenges of development, I bring a level of empathy that fosters a positive work environment. Understanding the intricacies of debugging, testing, and last-minute scope changes allows me to set realistic expectations, advocate for developers when needed, and create an environment where the team feels supported rather than pressured.

> I recall when there was an unexpected technical hurdle that extended development time. Instead of simply pushing for faster delivery, I reassessed project priorities, adjusted deadlines, communicated the issue to stakeholders and provided the necessary support for the team to deliver quality work avoiding burnout.

## Enhancing Agile and Scrum Practices

Full-stack developers often thrive in Agile environments, making them well-suited for project management roles that require iterative planning, sprint management, and backlog prioritisation. Having worked with Agile frameworks, I understand how to balance flexibility with structured planning, ensuring that projects remain adaptive yet efficient.

> When implementing Scrum for the SharePoint development team, I introduced Jira as a task management solution, streamlined sprint planning, and fostered a culture of continuous improvement. This significantly improved delivery timelines while keeping the team flexible in handling unexpected challenges.

## Conclusion

My transition from full-stack development to project management wasn’t about stepping away from technology, it was about leveraging my technical expertise to drive projects more effectively. By understanding the challenges developers face, making informed decisions, and fostering collaboration, a full-stack background can be a game-changer in project management.

For those considering this transition, my advice is to embrace both disciplines. The ability to speak the language of developers while keeping a strategic project view is, from my experience, a rare and valuable skill set that leads to more successful outcomes for teams and organisations alike.
