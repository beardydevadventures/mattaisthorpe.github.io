## Overview

The Virtual Streaming Studio is an interactive VR-based broadcasting system that allows users to engage with their virtual environment while live streaming their virtual camera to real-world platforms such as Teams, Zoom, and Facebook Messenger. Unlike traditional 2D video filters, this studio enables full 3D interaction, allowing streamers to use virtual camera setups, 3D props, and dynamic environments in real time.

Designed for content creators, educators, and professionals, this project aims to revolutionise remote communication and live streaming by offering an immersive and interactive alternative to webcam-based video calls.
