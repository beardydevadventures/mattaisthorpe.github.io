## Overview

Smash Room was created as an immersive VR experience that lets players unleash destruction in a risk-free virtual environment. The goal was to develop a highly interactive and satisfying way to break objects with realistic physics, making every impact feel dynamic and engaging.

One feature I’m particularly proud of is the ability to interact with partially destroyed objects, players can pick up and manipulate shards even when an object is split in half, enhancing the realism and depth of the experience.
