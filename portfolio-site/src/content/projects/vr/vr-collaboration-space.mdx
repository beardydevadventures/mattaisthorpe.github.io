## Overview

This project is a fully interactive VR collaboration space, designed to enable real-time communication, spatial interaction, and immersive teamwork. Built in Unity, the space provides a virtual environment where multiple users can connect, interact, and work together, leveraging the power of spatial computing and VR presence.

With remote work and virtual meetings becoming increasingly essential, this project explores how VR can enhance collaboration, making online interactions more engaging, dynamic, and productive compared to traditional video conferencing tools.
