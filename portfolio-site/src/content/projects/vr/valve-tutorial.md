## Overview

The VR Valve Tutorial was conceived to offer an immersive training simulation in virtual reality. This project aims to provide a risk-free learning environment where apprentices can master the skills necessary for valve assembly—enhancing their awareness, speeding up the learning process, and improving performance with minimal risk before they step into a physical workplace.

One feature I'm particularly proud of is the interactive callout UI, which effectively guides users by connecting descriptions directly to the relevant parts with a dynamic line.
