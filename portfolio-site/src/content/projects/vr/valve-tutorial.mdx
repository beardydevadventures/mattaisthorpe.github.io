## Overview

The VR Valve Tutorial is an immersive training simulation designed to help apprentices learn valve assembly in a risk-free virtual environment. By integrating interactive guidance, real-time feedback, and hands-on virtual practice, this experience enhances learning efficiency while minimising physical risks before users enter real-world industrial settings.

One standout feature is the interactive callout UI, which dynamically connects descriptions to relevant parts, allowing users to understand components in real time without breaking immersion.

This project aims to modernise technical education by bringing VR-based training into industries where hands-on experience is critical.
