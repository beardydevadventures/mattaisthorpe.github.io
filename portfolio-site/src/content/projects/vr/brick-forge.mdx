## Overview

Brick Forge was developed as part of the Meta Quest Presence Platform Hackathon 2024, leveraging Passthrough AR to display step-by-step 3D LEGO instructions in a real-world environment.

Instead of relying on traditional paper or digital manuals, users can place interactive LEGO instructions onto surfaces around them, using hand tracking and spatial anchoring to enhance the building experience. The app makes it easier to understand how pieces fit together, providing real-time, interactive 3D visualisation of LEGO models.
