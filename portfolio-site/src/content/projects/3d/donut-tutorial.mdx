## Overview

As I continue to refine my 3D modeling skills, I recently took on the challenge of creating a detailed donut model then assembled them in a stack using Blender 4.0. 

This project was inspired by "Blender Tutorial for Complete Beginners" by @blenderguru, a helpful resource that is packed with useful tips and tricks for navigating and mastering Blender.

## Process & Techniques

- 🔹 Modeling: Created the base shape using Blender’s subdivision modeling tools.
- 🔹 Texturing: Used geomtry nodes for procedural textures and details to enhance realism.
- 🔹 Lighting & Rendering: Experimented with HDRI lighting and cycles rendering to achieve a soft, natural look.
