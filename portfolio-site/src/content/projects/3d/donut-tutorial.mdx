## Overview

As part of refining my 3D modeling skills, I created a highly detailed stack of donuts using Blender 4.0. This project focused on procedural texturing, realistic lighting, and high-quality rendering to achieve a natural look.

Inspired by the Blender Tutorial for Complete Beginners by @blenderguru, this project helped me further explore Blender’s powerful modeling, shading, and rendering capabilities.

## Process & Techniques

- ✅ Modeling: Created the base shape using Blender’s subdivision modeling tools.
- ✅ Texturing: Used geomtry nodes for procedural textures and details to enhance realism.
- ✅ Lighting & Rendering: Experimented with HDRI lighting and cycles rendering to achieve a soft, natural look.

## Technology Stack:
Software: Blender 4.0
Rendering Engine: Cycles
Texturing: Procedural (Geometry Nodes)
