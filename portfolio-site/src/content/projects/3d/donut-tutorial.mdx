## Overview

As I continue to refine my 3D modeling skills, I recently took on the challenge of creating a detailed donut model then assembled them in a stack using Blender 4.0. 

This project was inspired by "Blender Tutorial for Complete Beginners" by @blenderguru, a helpful resource that is packed with useful tips and tricks for navigating and mastering Blender.
