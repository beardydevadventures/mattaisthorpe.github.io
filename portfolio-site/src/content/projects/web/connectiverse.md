## Overview

Connectiverse was developed as part of GovHack 2022 by Think Rhino, a five-member team. The platform is designed to help individuals share and develop skills by matching users who want to learn a skill with those who can teach it.

The application also supports career exploration, enabling students to input their existing skills and discover potential career paths, as well as the additional skills they need to pursue their goals. Local businesses and organizations can also use Connectiverse to organize events and engage with students who have relevant skill sets.
