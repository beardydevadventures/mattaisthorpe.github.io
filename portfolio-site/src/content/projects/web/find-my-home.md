## Overview

Working with a team called <i>Mana Jaja</i> consisting of four members at Govhack. <strong>Find My Home</strong> allows users to set preferences of what they would prefer in the next area they move to. 

These preferences are then checked against the ABS data for regions to determine those that fall within the preferences and highlights them on a map. 

These highlighted areas can then be clicked on for more details to help inform the user with future moving locations.
