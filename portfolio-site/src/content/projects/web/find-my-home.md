## Overview

Find My Home was developed as part of GovHack 2021 by Mana Jaja, a four-member team. The app allows users to input their preferences for an ideal place to live—such as cost of living, safety, public amenities, and lifestyle factors. These preferences are then matched against ABS data to highlight regions that meet the user’s criteria.

Users can explore the recommended locations on an interactive map, click on highlighted areas for more details, and make more informed decisions about their future home.
